Hi, I’m Nicolò Candiani—a theoretical physics MSc student at Utrecht University. I’m currently working on my master’s thesis at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, focusing on holography and conformal field theory. I enjoy building simulations, explaining tough concepts clearly, and collaborating on research projects.

This site shares my background, teaching experience, and work-in-progress ideas. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss physics, code, or potential collaborations.
